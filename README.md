# Chatty Web Chat App

Build a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

Itâ€™s a page that opens in the browser, and shows the messages in colored bubbles (think something like WhatsApp).

## Requirements
 
* On one side the computer will generate a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages.
 
* The screen should automatically flow and follow the messages posted, like in all chat apps.
 
* Each message should have an indication of the date and time it was sent.
 
* Your CSS needs to be clean.
 
* Use 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript and jQuery.
